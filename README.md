Secure Data Hiding in Images using Steganography
📌 Project Overview
This project provides a secure and user-friendly way to encrypt and decrypt messages within images using steganography and password protection.
The message is embedded inside an image using OpenCV and can only be retrieved with the correct password.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python – Programming language
Tkinter (tk)
Pillow (for image manipulation)
Stegano (for steganography operations)

🔥 Features
✔ Steganography-based encryption – Hides messages within image pixels.
✔ Password-protected decryption – Ensures secure message retrieval.
✔ Graphical User Interface (GUI) – Easy-to-use interface.
✔ No need for external storage – The message is stored directly in the image.
✔ Works with PNG images – Saves encrypted images in lossless format.

🚀 Usage
Encrypt an Image
Run the encryption script:
python encrypt.py
Enter the secret message
Click on Encrypt Image, and it will generate an encrypted image.
Decrypt an Image
Run the decryption script:
python decrypt.py
select the image for decrypton
and the message hides in image shown .
